# Dengue Predictor (Team 25)

A web based project using machine learning models to predict the dengue outbreak in India

# Project Design

#### Machine Learning Model Training Phase

We would be designing a machine learning model which will be considering multiple factors such as rainfall, temprature and vegetation. We would be using Numpy and Pandas to clean the data and bring it in structured format. Then we will be using Numpy to implement our machine learning algorithm on the training data.

#### Machine Learning Model Testing Phase

#### Visualization Phase using Google Maps API
